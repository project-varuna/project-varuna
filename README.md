# 🌟 Welcome to Project Varuna! 🌟

Hi there! 
I'm **Ajinkya Joglekar**, a passionate Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious **Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research (ICAR)**, nestled in the vibrant city of Greenville, SC. I'm thrilled to share my journey and research in the cutting-edge realm of on-road and off-road Uncrewed Ground Vehicle systems (UGVs). 🚗 :robot:

## 🚀 About Project Varuna:
Project Varuna is an innovative framework grounded in my research on Koopman Operator Theory. This platform distills the insights and innovations from my work into a standalone package, empowering users to build explainable, data-driven models with just a few clicks, making advanced autonomy accessible to all.

🔍 **Key Highlights:**

- **Multi-Model Parameterized Koopman (MMPK) approach:** Captures vehicle dynamics using a curvature-parameterized family of Koopman models, ensuring coverage across the entire operational envelope. 
- **Novel Reachability-Based Planners:** Sample a set of feasible trajectories to bridge Sim2Real gaps and mitigate terrain perturbations. 
- **Linear Feedback Controller in Lifted Space:** Enables robust path-tracking in real-time, even on systems with limited computational resources. 
- **Open-Source Packages & User-Friendly GUI:** No complex setup or dependencies! Simply select modeling, planning, and control parameters through the GUI, and you're ready to go! 
- **Cross-Compatibility:** Works with multiple simulators (e.g. AutoDRIVE Ecosystem, Nvidia Isaac Sim) and hardware platforms, from 1/10th scale (F1Tenth) to mid-scale (Hunter SE) and full-scale vehicles.
  
By blending these pipelines, Project-Varuna aims to enhance the intelligence and decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles, pushing their operational envelope even further in diverse and challenging conditions.

## 🤝 Collaboration and Contributions:
I firmly believe in the power of **teamwork**. I'm always open to collaborating with like-minded individuals and teams to tackle autonomy's most challenging problems. Together, we can pool our expertise and create groundbreaking solutions that shape the future of autonomous systems.
